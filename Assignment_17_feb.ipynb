    "1.Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in the form of documents rather than \n",
    "  tables with rows and columns. Documents are similar to JSON objects, making them easy to work with for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's data model is flexible, which means that data can be easily added, changed or removed without affecting the \n",
    "  structure of the entire database. This is useful when working with data that is constantly changing, as it allows for more agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable, which means that it can easily handle large amounts of data and distribute it across multiple \n",
    "  servers. This makes it a good choice for applications that need to scale quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.High Performance: MongoDB is designed to provide high performance, even with large amounts of data. It uses in-memory computing and\n",
    "  allows for indexing and query optimization to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Automatic Sharding: MongoDB can automatically distribute data across multiple servers using a process called sharding. This helps to \n",
    "  ensure high availability and performance for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports complex queries, including joins, aggregation, and full-text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Support for Secondary Indexes: MongoDB supports secondary indexes, which makes it easy to find data based on any field in the document."
